This is a bepinex plugin (mod as the AOC community calls it) to disable vsynch/unlimit the application FPS. 
This won't improve your game's performance or make it appear any faster, this will simply stop the upper limit of your game's FPS being capped at 60 (or whatever else your monitor's refresh rate is).
It's more for people who want to use AOC as some sort of twisted performance benchmark program or really really hate input latency.
